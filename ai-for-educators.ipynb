    "**Recall** is the ability of a classifier to find all positive instances. It can be calculated by dividing the number of True Positives by the sum of True Positives and False Negatives. Simply labelling all classes as positive would result in a recall rate of 100% (or 1) for that class, but would drastically reduce precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision and recall are like different sides of a see-saw; as one increases, the other decreases (for the same dataset). **F1 Score** is a balanced average of the two scores, and is often reported when evaluating a model's performance.\n",

    "For all three measurements, a value of 1.0 is perfectly accurate, and 0.0 is perfectly useless. Support is the number of samples belonging to each class."

    "So as we can see in the exercise here, machine learning is relatively simple to implement. With only a few collected variables, we can estimate our outcome of interest (Selected Sport) with high accuracy. In our example, after we trained the model, only one of the 30 students whose data we ran through the model was misclassified. The term misclassified here has a specific definition, because the data we used to *test* the model already had known values (ground truths) for the sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, once you've trained and validated your model and put it into use, it's much more difficult to know how accurate your results are. Even the most accurate machine learning models can only be accurate to the data that was used to construct them, and if that data is messy (or **biased**), that can affect the conclusions that are drawn from them. There's a saying in computer science that's been around since the field's inception: *'Garbage in, garbage out'*. This is the most important role of anyone creating any data science or algorithmic content, ensuring that the data entering the model is as fair and equitable as possible:"
